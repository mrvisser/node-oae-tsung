/**
 * Data configuration file for a tsung test. You can configure various types of dynamic data that is wired into your tsung test.
 *
 * ## CSV File Data
 * 
 * Configured using a `files` object. The key of each file is the expected file name (before ".csv"), and is also used as the file
 * ID in the Tsung test. Each variable name in the vars array enumerates each column in the CSV file, and is expected to be in
 * proper order. The order specifies in what order the rows will be read from the CSV file (`iter` or `random`).
 * 
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 *  "files": {
 *      "users": {
 *          "order": "random",
 *          "vars": [ "first_name", "last_name", "display_name" ]
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Random Strings
 *
 * Configured using a `strings` object:
 *
 * ```
 *  "strings": {
 *      "_str_random_med": {
 *          "length": 50
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Random Numbers
 *
 * ```
 *  "numbers": {
 *      "_num_random": {
 *          "start": 0,
 *          "end": 100
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
